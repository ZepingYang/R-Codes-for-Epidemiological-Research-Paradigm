# Repository Introduction

This repository is created to share the R codes I accumulated during my journey of epidemiological research.

It's both a summary of my own coding work and a handbook to help my academic fellows conduct their research smoothly.

If there are any questions about the coding, please contact me by e-mail: [zepingyang@bjmu.edu.cn](mailto:zepingyang@bjmu.edu.cn)
